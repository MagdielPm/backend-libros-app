# Backend library application 💻

Rest market application with Node.js

## Setup your machine

### Install Yarn

Visit the official site of [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started) and install in your machine. 🐈

### Install Postgres

**Note**: Homebrew is only for Mac OS X. 🍺

1. Install by Homebrew [Postgresql Mac](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew) or [Postgres Win](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) follow the steps and add postgres to your path. 🐘
2. Go to the terminal and check if postgres was installed correctly with this command `postgres -V` you should see your postgres version in the terminal. 👨🏽‍💻
3. Start the postgres service in your machine, in case of Mac, just run `brew start services postgres`
4. The next step is create your local database with this command in your terminal `createdb rest-library`.
5. I recommend you download a GUI to manage your database [Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) and connect your postgres just with `rest-library` in the `Default database` section.
6. Run the migrations in your terminal `yarn migrate`.
7. Add the seeds to the project with `yarn add-seeds`.
8. OPTIONAL: If you have to delete the migrations for some mistake just run `yarn down-migrate`.

### Install postman to test your endpoints

Visit the official site of [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and download the aplication. 🚀
